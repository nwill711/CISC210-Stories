# CISC210-Stories

Create a story about the fireball game, create the JIRA issue, create a branch named from the story, write the story into this file
(README.md), and then do a pull request for your changes.

As a player, I want points every time a candle is hit with the fireball so that I can keep track of my score and gloat.

When I light a candle, my score goes up by 1.
